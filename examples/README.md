JeeRev example area
====================

Each example in this directory is designed to work out of the box, but you may
have to adjust a configuration file (called `config.txt`) to match your setup:

1. Copy `config-example.txt` to `config.txt` (if it exists) and edit as needed.
2. Run the code by typing `jeemon -app examples/<dirname>` from the JeeRev dir.
3. There is no step 3.
