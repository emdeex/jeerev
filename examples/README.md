Each example in this directory should work out of the box, but you may have to
adjust a configuration file (called `config.txt`) to match your setup:

1. Copy `config-sample.txt` to `config.txt` (if it exists) and edit as needed.
2. Run the code by typing `jeemon -app examples/<dirname>` from the JeeRev dir.
3. There is no step 3.

Examples
--------

* **helloRF12** - Collect and display data from a JeeNode running RF12demo.
* **helloWeb** - The simplest possible web server.
