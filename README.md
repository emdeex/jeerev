JeeRev
======

JeeRev is the core library for use with [JeeMon][1], containing the generic code
needed to create applications for Physical Computing and Home Automation.

For more information about JeeRev, see the [JeeRev home page][2].

Usage
-----

The default `jeemon-rev` core library is automatically downloaded by JeeMon on
startup. The download site at JeeLabs is <http://dl.jeelabs.org/>. To download
an updated version, delete the `jeemon-rev` file and relaunch JeeMon.

For easy development, if a `kit` directory is present, it'll be used instead.

To run the test suites, type `make`.

To generate the `jeemon-rev` file, type `make wrap`.
